## Hello, you have stumbled my GitHub profile.
Feel free to view my projects I have made in the past, who knows it could be helpful to you too.

- I am a computer science student.
- I am mostly working in Java, but I occasionally work on PHP, C and other programming languages I find interesting.
- I don't code often right now, but I do when I feel like working on one.
- My computer isn't that great. :P
